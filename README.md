# OpenCV Face Recognition
Welcome to the OpenCV Face Recognition repository. [OpenCV Face Recognition product](https://opencv.org/opencv-face-recognition/) offers world-class face recogition ranked top 10 in NIST FRVT, powered by Seventh Sense.

We provide Python SDK (Jupyter notebook), C++ SDK, RESTful API, Flutter app code which can be integrated with the OpenCV Face Recognition (FR) API. [Try Demo here](https://developer.opencv.fr/ui/#/onboard/demo). 

## Getting Started
To use the OpenCV Face Recognition [Python SDK](https://docs.opencv.fr/python/), [C++ SDK](https://docs.opencv.fr/cpp/), [RESTful API](https://us.opencv.fr/docs), first register an account at the [OpenCV Face Recognition Developer Portal](https://developer.opencv.fr/).

After registering, you can find your **Developer Key** on the **Dashboard** once you log in.

You will need your **Developer Key** to use Python SDK/C++ SDK/RESTful API

We highly recommend that you use [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GcpxvwkMi7xmb2YSeq7HyEeADgb9oStd#scrollTo=Oa6drLDk0EzI) while familiarizing yourself with our APIs, and planning the UI for your own users.
